Iridium is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which replaces the game rendering and audio engine implementations with ones that make use of Vulkan and FMOD respectively. The goal of Iridium is to make Minecraft more enjoyable by providing increased frame rates with Vulkan and a better (and potentially more immersive) audio experience with FMOD.

Currently, Iridium is still in active development so expect instability issues, rendering/audio bugs and/or crashes. In addition, due to FMOD being a part LWJGL 3.3.2 and (at the time of writing) it not being in stable release, FMOD support will not be worked on until LWJGL 3.3.2 is in stable release and Minecraft has been updated to that version of LWJGL. For now, Vulkan support is the primary focus of the mod's development.
